# Laboratory_samples

**About Dataset:**

This dataset is an actual summary of the number of samples in the laboratory in individual months of the years 2009 - 2022.

Based on the collected data, I want to predict the number of samples in individual months in 2023.

I am going to analyze the trend of data using regression, using the example of forecasting the number of samples in the laboratory - predicting future data values using a method that combines trend analysis with seasonality analysis.
